### 리눅스 리소스 확인


- 리눅스 내 리소스를 모니터링할 필요가 있어 관련 자료를 참고해봤다



Top command

- one of the frequently used command by many of the Linux administrator to understand and view the resource utilization by process on the server



### 1) basic command

```
top -c
```

* 5 main output rows and etc

Row1 - > system uptime from the last reboot, currently logged in users, CPU load for last 5/10/15 min on the system

```
ROW1
top:08:44:56(current System Time) up 162 days, 16:07(System Uptime),  4 users(Currently logged in Users Count),  load average: 1.00, 1.05, 0.93(CPU Average Load in 1/5/15 min)
```

Row2 -> shows the number of process currently running on the system and their state

Zombie processor defunct process is a child's process that has completed execution but exist due to dead of parent processes.

```
ROW2
Tasks: 263 total,   1 running, 262 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
```

Row3 -> shows the CPU utilization status on the system

Shows the Percentage of CPU used by User Processes, System Processes, Hardware and Software Interrupts. Percentage of CPU in Idle State and Percentage of CPU waiting for I/O/

**Steal time -> percentage of time a virtual CPU waits for a real CPU while the hypervisor is servicing another virtual processor.

```
Cpu(s):  7.4%us,  0.8%sy,  0.0%ni, 91.7%id,  0.0%wa,  0.0%hi,  0.0%si,  0.0%st
us -> Percentage of the CPU used for User Processes
sy -> Percentage of the System Processes
ni -> Percentage of the CPU used for setting up a nice value
id -> Percentage of the cpu in Idle State
wa -> Percentage of CPU waiting for I/O
hi -> Percentage of the CPU used for Hardware Interrupts
si -> Percentage of the CPU used for Software Interrupts
st -> Steal time(%)
```

Row4 -> sshows the memory utilization status on the system

```
Mem:  32949868k total, 13928996k used, 19020872k free,  1323780k buffers
total -> total memory in system
used -> current used memory by system
free -> free memory
buffers -> ?
```

Row5 -> Swap utilization status on the system. shows total swap memory in system, current swap utilization, free swap memory and total cached memory by system

```
Swap:  6144852k total,        0k used,  6144852k free, 10745792k cached

total -> total Swap Memory in system
used -> current used Swap memory by system
free -> Free Swap Memory
cached -> Total Cached Memory by System
```

Row6 ~

-> specific information related to respective process



Memory per process

```
top -c -b -o +%MEM | head -n 20 | tail -15
```

option description

* b - starting in batch mode
* c - allow additional parameters
* d [sec] - Refresh on stated seconds

Available option after command

* `Shift` +m -> descending process by Memory size
* `Shift` + p -> descending process by CPU usage
* `Shift` + t -> descending process by total time

Output:
PID : PID of running Process

USER: Owner of the Process

PR: Priority of running Process

NI: Nice value of running Process

VIRT: Virtual Memory used by Process

RES: Physical Memory used by Process

SHR: Shared Memory used by Process

S: Current status of running Process

%CPU: Percentage of the CPU used by the Current Process

%MEM: Percentage of the memory used by the Current Process

TIME: how long the process being Running

COMMAND: Name of Process
